Student Front-end Developer from Itajaí, Santa Catarina, Brazil, currently pursuing a degree in System Analysis and Development. My first "Hello World" experience was in 2023, when I got in touch with HTML, CSS, and a bit of JavaScript, and now I'm studying Python. Passionate about art and technology, some of my hobbies include gaming, watching movies, reading, creating, and traveling the world.
